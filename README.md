# GomokuAI

This is an on-going research project. The project aims to understand the behavior of Neural Networks by training a Gomoku AI using reinforcement learning.

## Current progress
- A Gomoku game built on Pygame
- Building a Artificial Neural Network framework (LightNeuNet)

## Ongoing tasks
- Build an ANN using Numpy
- Build a CNN using Numpy
- Train the model
- Report
- Presentation

## LightNeuNet
LightNeuNet is a light-weight Neural Network framework built for academic use. Since the author is only a Y3 student, the framework should only be used for academic and hilarious purposes. Please do not use it in production **yet**.
